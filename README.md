Two scripts that run on the file Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx.
Both files summarize stocks from the year and provides each stocks' yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume.
They also identify which stock had the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and greatest total volume from the year.
One script loops through all years at once, while the other script runs on one worksheet at a time.
